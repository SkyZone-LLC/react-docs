# Clicky Game

## Overview

For this activity, you'll create a memory game with React. It will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

### Instructions

1. Check out the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.
    - In case if the link is broken. Please let us know, so we can fix it.

2. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for **click events**.

4. The application should keep **track** of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should **shuffle** themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should **restart**.

7. Add **test folder** and write couple of test suites for your app.

#### Hints

* Begin by building a non-functioning static version for your Clicky Game. Then work on making the game interactive.

* Ask the instructor or a TA if you're having difficulty understanding any of the activity requirements.

## Stretch Challenge (Bonus)

- Once you complete all of the basic functionality for this activity, work on adding additional styles and making it look great. (Even change the look of the page entirely)
